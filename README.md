# RAKwireless_W5100S_Ethernet_library

Rakwireless W5100S Ethernet library is modified from Arduino Ethernet library (V2.0.0) for the Arduino platform, because this library is very comprehensive and supports W5100/W5200/W5500 devices. We have added support for W5100S and made adaptations to RAK4631, RAK11200, and RAK11300 platforms.

# Documentation

* **[Product Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK13800_W5100S)** - Product repository for the RAKWireless RAK13005 LIN Bus module.
* **[Documentation](https://docs.RAKWireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK13800/Overview/)** - Documentation and Quick Start Guide for the RAK13800 Ethernet module.

# Installation

In Arduino IDE open Sketch->Include Library->Manage Libraries then search for RAK13800.

In PlatformIO open PlatformIO Home, switch to libraries and search for RAK13005.
Or install the library project dependencies by adding

```log
lib_deps =
  RAKWireless/RAKwireless_W5100S
```

into **`platformio.ini`**

For manual installation download the archive, unzip it and place the RAKwireless_W5100S folder into the library directory.
In Arduino IDE this is usually <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/
In PlatformIO this is usually <user/.platformio/lib>

# Usage

The library provides an interface class, which allows communication with W5100S via SPI. These examples show how to use RAK13800.

- [RAK13800_Ethernet_DHCP_W5100S](./examples/RAK13800_Ethernet_DHCP_W5100S) Get an IP address via DHCP and print the address obtained.
- [RAK13800_Ethernet_HTTP_Client_W5100S](./examples/RAK13800_Ethernet_HTTP_Client_W5100S) This example connects to a website (http://www.google.com).
- [RAK13800_Ethernet_HTTP_Server_W5100S](./examples/RAK13800_Ethernet_HTTP_Server_W5100S) A simple web server that shows the value of the analog input pins.
- [RAK13800_Ethernet_MQTT_Publish_W5100S](./examples/RAK13800_Ethernet_MQTT_Publish_W5100S) This example connects to a MQTT broker and publishes a message to a topic once a second.
- [RAK13800_Ethernet_MQTT_Subscribes_W5100S](./examples/RAK13800_Ethernet_MQTT_Subscribes_W5100S) This example connects to a MQTT broker and subscribes to a single topic. When a message is received it prints the message to the serial monitor.
- [RAK13800_Ethernet_TCP_Client_W5100S](./examples/RAK13800_Ethernet_TCP_Client_W5100S) Establish connection with TCP server and send data.
- [RAK13800_Ethernet_TCP_Server_W5100S](./examples/RAK13800_Ethernet_TCP_Server_W5100S) A simple server can communicate with any connected TCP client.
- [RAK13800_Ethernet_UDP_W5100S](./examples/RAK13800_Ethernet_UDP_W5100S) Receives UDP message strings, prints them to the serial port and sends an "acknowledge" string back to the sender.

## This class provides the following methods:

**Notes: Below is the important API. For more, please look the [official instructions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet).**

**static void begin(uint8_t *mac, IPAddress ip);
static void begin(uint8_t *mac, IPAddress ip, IPAddress dns);
static void begin(uint8_t *mac, IPAddress ip, IPAddress dns, IPAddress gateway);
static void begin(uint8_t *mac, IPAddress ip, IPAddress dns, IPAddress gateway, IPAddress subnet);**

Initializes the ethernet library and network settings.

#### Parameters:

| Direction | Name    | Function                                                     |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| in        | mac     | The MAC (Media access control) address for the device (array of 6 bytes). this is the Ethernet hardware address of your shield. Newer Arduino Ethernet Shields include a sticker with the device's MAC address. For older shields, choose your own. |
| in        | ip      | The IP address of the device (array of 4 bytes).             |
| in        | dns     | The IP address of the DNS server (array of 4 bytes). optional: defaults to the device IP address with the last octet set to 1. |

**static EthernetHardwareStatus hardwareStatus();**

`Ethernet.hardwareStatus()` tells you which WIZnet Ethernet controller chip was detected during `Ethernet.begin()`, if any. This can be used for troubleshooting. If no Ethernet controller was detected then there is likely a hardware problem.

#### Parameters:

| Direction | Name | Function                                                     |
